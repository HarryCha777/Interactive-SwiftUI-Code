# About this App

Would you like to get hands-on experience with SwiftUI instead of just seeing its screenshots?

If so, then this app is for you!

Since this app is built using SwiftUI, you can experiment and interact with SwiftUI instead of simply looking at the screenshots.

(This app is only available on iOS because Swift only runs on Apple products.)
